# Button-Clicker-Android-App-Project

This is my first android app project to familiarize myself with Android Studio.

Funtionalities include:
- Implementing a save functionality where the data in the input text field and the textview area are saved and restored when the app is closed, and when the user changes the phone's orientation.
- Adding a count button that counts how many times it's been pressed and writes the information down on a textview area.
- Adding a button that resets the count of the count button. 
- Adding a button that writes user input from an input text field into the textview area.
- Adding a button that deletes the text in the text view area.
